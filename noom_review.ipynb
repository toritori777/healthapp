              "11  i was doing great with this app. i love the articles that they have to read, the way that they show you how to choose your food wisely so you can keep on track. however, i was logged off by the app and required to sign back in. have not been able to get back on the app since january 1, 2021. i've contacted support and at least 3 to 4 times a day i get the same suggestion to fix my problem from a different person at support. i just realized tonight that it is coming from zendesk which is an app and not real people which explains why i am being told to do the same thing over and over again that does not work. there is no way to contact a person at noom to get help. i am so disappointed that i cannot use this app any longer. i even tried starting a new account with a different email and it still keeps bringing me to the window to upgrade which means i have to pay again and i have done this twice with no luck. every time i sign in it comes back to the i want to upgrade window and will not allow me into the actual app. it is so frustrating not to be able to talk to someone to get help with this. i really wanted to continue to use this app and had planned on paying the $200 for the year to reward myself on new year's day but found myself locked out. i even sent an email to the ceo, saeju joeng and received a reply from zendesk. i was only able to use this app for 4 months.\\ngreat app if you are able to use it.                                            \n",
              "16  i have been using noom on and off for 4 years after successful weight loss but the one thing i always hated is that they say you can customize your own recipe but that is not true. the calories is automatically generated and is always wrong. for example, i am trying to log a recipe with 725 calories, it automatically makes it 2725 calories and you can't change/correct it. i was told by support that it can take 3-6 months for the recipe to be in the system. what if you want to log it because you just had it and want to stay on track with your calories but can't see it in your calorie bar because it is incorrect? there is no place to type the correct information. makes no sense why noom doesn't have it and lifesum does. i might switch to lifesum because i do not want to wait 3-6 months to log a recipe i just ate. i want to know how much i eat calorie wise. noom should have made it so it so you can fully customize your dish and nutrition info. this is the biggest let down of the app.\\ni have talked to support about this 5 times in the past 2 days and most of them are clueless to what i want and those that do understand say \"it can take up to 3-6 months for it to finalize\". i have tried this before and it never goes through. i tried 2 years ago and do you think anything happened? nope. really upset with how noom handles this. just make it so we can enter are own nutrition information. lifesum does it                                                    \n",
              "25  the first 2 levels of lessons (equivalent to 1.5 months of the program) were interesting and offered useful information about how to look at food and your food habits. however after completing the second level of lessons the information became uninteresting and wasn't adding up to my knowledge. second, i entered a plateau in the third week of the program that i couldn't get out from in four weeks. i started counting macros and my weight started shifting down again. this made me realize that noom's system of food tracking based on colors was not helping me loose weight as i was filling up my diet with carbs (fruit and vegetables and some grains). when i turned to the in-demand coaching it was a huge dissatisfaction because i went in circles with them for three weeks - they would tell me that i plateaud because i was eating too little calories, only to realize they were wrong every time (this happened three times). when i moved to the 'goal coach' it was also disappointing because instead of giving me advice she literally said 'loosing 6 pounds might be tricky, but you know what to do so you got it!' really?! i never said i lacked motivation what i lacked was guidance to overcome the plateau and the coaches and noom tracking system really disappointed.\\nmy goal was to loose 12 pounds in 4 months. i am back in track but under a macro diet, not noom.                                                                                                       \n",
              "28  i would love to be able to write this review as a noom user, however i can't even get the app to open with my information. after about seven months of actively using noom on a daily basis, i lost the weight that i had wanted to lose successfully (about 20 lbs). i was feeling happy and healthy and really excited about the results, so i decided to put a hold on the program itself and continue to use the app. what a mistake that was! the moment that i stopped paying a subscription, the app started to give me a lot of problems. some of these issues were issues that i had experienced as a subscriber previously such as not being able to put in the foods after the meals or my step counter getting stuck however after my subscription, the app decided to not work for me at all. i did everything possible and contacted customer support a number of times to try to get this resolved to no avail. it's not the phone, it's also an off the app they say, but i can't enter noom at all. one of my issues upon contacting customer support was that i was considering going back to being a paying subscriber, but how can i do that when the app won't even open for me to begin with? we shouldn't be chastised for deciding that we need a break from the program as i mentioned in the title great results, horrible app. i hope that they solve this problem eventually, but i doubt it as it's been months for me!                                                                           \n",
              "34  to be fair ive lost interest in this app. im 4 months in and all i get from this is log food and drink water and read some reports and answer quizzes, my attention span does not handle quizzes very well. so this whole physiological app is very turning me off. on top of the first 2 months had articles that were audio that which really got me interested and which my active life being a traveling musician. i just dont find my attention span to do read research articles and be tested everyday. so i hate logging meals. having to describe each item of food or recipe into an app takes forever. i felt that i spend at least a hour total a day logging food into this app. talk about being judgmental and weary all day of what i have to eat. not good for my mental health. fail on this app. way to be diet plan app with a fresh look. i had a death in the family and had to put the app on pause. i go to my gym quite often. noom suggested exercise 3 months into the app but now i can pay more then the $160 plan for noom food plan and what not at $40 extra. but my artist management has paired me with a dietitian and personal trainer. and not getting wild reviews from the doctors. this app was misleading. at least they agreed to end my subscription after 8 months. either way hope for the best for everyone else on this. if this app updates to more of what i got into 4 months ago. maybe ill participate more                                                                \n",
              "38  i like the ideas behind my his app - applying psychology to weight loss and developing the tools and habits to maintain a healthy weight long term. it has helped me lose weight and work toward my goals. bravo! unfortunately, in the six months that i've been using noom, the user interface has gone steadily downhill. it's now slow to load and slow to commit user data (e.g. during food logging). why? isn't this app mostly cached static content + a small database? the app will also periodically log me out \"for security reasons\" and refuse to login without an internet connection - very frustrating when trying to catch up while on a flight w/o wifi. i also find the graphics repetitive and insipid. new fonts are also all wrong. any app that requires frequent user data input (like food logging) needs to feel like it loads and responds instantaneously. this one used to be fast and it's not now. also every software release is not a \"major release.\" some are probably more about new features, some more about bug fixes, etc. if noom's release notes were less cheerleading and more factual and specific, the user responses to releases would follow suit. in general, it appears that noom needs to hire some more experienced software architects and incorporate higher ui performance metrics in their release criteria. life is too short for slow-loading software with cheesy repetitive graphics.                                                                             \n",
              "39  where do i begin? signed up through itunes and quickly realized that noom charges $44 per month; bu if going through their site, it is $199 per year if paid upfront. there should be the same price irrespective of where one signs up. when my free trial period was almost over, i cancelled the itunes subscription and went to the site on the desktop. when going through the subscription steps, a page popped up asking me to help pay for the costs of the free trial period. also, while signing up, i had to go through several screens soliciting add-on services and invitations for my contacts. finally, i got to the page with registration information. once i filled it out and hit send, a message popped up that an account like this already exists. i then tried accessing the account through an app and received a message that there is no such account. talk about self contradiction! after spending 15-20 on the chat line with support, and then as much on the phone with support, we finally got my account reinstated and i was able to register on the desktop. after that all i had to do was delete and reload the app, enable cookies and change the password again on the account and it seems to be working. i can't seem to access the data that i accumulated during the introductory phase, but i am too exhausted to contact support about it. time will tell how successful the app is with losing weight, but the administrative part has been very unpleasant thus far.           \n",
              "43  i like this app but the developers could make it much more user friendly. first, i need to be able to see my food diary without trying to log a meal. there needs to be a tab called food diary and another called analytics where you can see your \"colors\" as they develop across the day. currently, you can only see the diary or macro breakdown if you are about to log a food. sometimes you want to see your progress without entering food, to analyze your data to plan ahead, but you can't with this app. also, i like to log ahead i do this in myfitnesspal if i know my work day will be busy, and this keeps me on track. you can't do that on noom. there is no way to plan ahead. this is particularly bad if i know i'm going out for one meal and need to plan the other meals to be lighter and as a result, i keep going over, even trying to be conservative. and, finally, noom doesn't have a tab for logging exercise. you have to select \"do more\" and drill down to the limited exercise menu, which needs more options. they need to add hiit workouts there. and finally, this is the beginning of week 2, and i have yet to talk to a goal specialist. i've gotten some bot-type interactions, but she won't actually respond to me or my questions. she's just kind of a push notification, like \"good job for logging veggies today!\" the cost is supposed to pay for the coach. if there's no coach, then this is just a less robust version of myfitnesspal.                                \n",
              "53  i am feeling very disappointedwhen i started this program i was looking forward to some helpful suggestions and coaching for ideas i am having trouble with by myself. i've been on the program for a while and my weight is actually more now than when i started, and when i ask for helpful suggestions i am being responded by what are my thoughts..my thoughts are i am seeking that guidance and help and that's why i am trying to obtain helpful information in which i am not able to have those answers.. i really do like the part of helping to log my food for a daily intake however i have asked several times for guidance on calorie intake wondering if this would help he achieve my goals to lose the weight and i keep getting asked what my thoughts are for the amount i have no idea hug and that is why i am asking for some support help in guidance if this is not part of this program would you be able to recommend that is? i started at 112 about 2 months ago & i am know at 112.8. i do make healthy choices on food & right now my calorie intake on the app allows my calorie intake up 1200 calories so that is what i was going by. again i was told you can do more but i was looking for a suggested amount to help because i do not know what ballpark area i should be at. i was hoping to be around 105 by now & like i said i am farther away than closer to that target area.. any helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated..                                            \n",
              "55  i loved noom through the first month. i actually lost 9 lbs and felt like i was finally on my way to weight loss. it's now been nearly three months and i haven't lost any more weight. obviously i am responsible for my self control, but noom doesn't provide a system to make you feel back on track once you get off track. first, they send you 5-6 articles a day which get to be exhausting over a long period. many articles build on each other so if you miss three or four days then you will see references from previous articles you won't understand unless you go digging through those that you missed. when you're struggling to revive motivation, becoming weighed down by information is not helpful. second, the weight loss coaches are amateur. i've had two now and i've had the same issues with both: very slow response time and unhelpful advice. for response timing, i've waited as much as five days for a response to a simple question. as for the content of the advice, it's mostly questions in a socratic form or stuff that is already heavily hit on in the articles. if i ask a question, 90% of the responses are another question. \"what can i do to stop my junk food cravings?\" \"well, what are some habits you could form to avoid craving junk?\" if i could answer that question, i wouldn't have asked. i appreciate the system for what it is, but i did pay a lot of money to get the program.                                                                              \n",
              "57  i had really high hopes for this app! first let me start off that after 2 weeks of your trial, they will charge you $130 for 4 months without notice. you also can't get a refund if you're not satisfied with that because \"you had two weeks to cancel\". i guess that was my fault. next thing is, you start off with a 2000 calorie budget and then it drops lower and lower. i feel as if noom wants me to starve myself. i work outside, i am constantly sweating and walking around. i'm going to eat, and i shouldn't have to feel bad about going over 1300 calories while eating healthy foods. second of all, they list some foods that are high in nutrition like almonds/peanut butter and oatmeal as \"red foods\". this makes me feel like i can't eat anything, i only have so much time to make something quick and healthy that will fill me up until lunch time. overall, i'm really not pleased with this app! i know it's all psych tricks to make you break your bad habits but it's just not working for me. i really wish i could get my money back. the only good part is counting my calories and seeing if my weight goes down by logging it in. i also believe they should let us take pictures of our meals for accurate calorie calculations, as in they measure how much calories our plate has and we list the things in them. that would help! i don't recommend noom if you're broke like me, just constantly go to the gym and eat more veggies than yummy foods! that's been working for me!  \n",
              "58  i do like this app overall, i like the way it works and how it's different than other programs, but logging food is such a pain. it could be so much better easier to log (seems like a lot of steps to get to the logging part and isn't that an important piece of this app?) and then the nutrition information is often wrong. i initially liked that it had so many foods already in its database, but i find i have to check the info to the food packages and it's often wrong, so then i have to input it separately or find a way to change my portion in the app to correctly log the calories i consumed. this is really annoying and a huge disappointment. i've used other apps like lose it which seemed more accurate overall. wish their databases could be updated. i contacted them once and they said that the info was wrong because the manufacturer changed their portion size since their last update. i can't imagine almost everything in my house has been changed since their last update- get it together please!\\nwanted to add that logging food is a tedious process. would be nice to have faster ways to log and it to be a bit cleaner of a process. since the tracking is important for me i'll be going back to the lose it app as their logging is so much easier. noom- you are on to something great, but seriously get correct nutrition info and make logging for a lot easier!                                                                                                       \n",
              "63  i have been trying noom for over two months and have lost a mere 3 pounds even though i log all my foods and stay within my daily alloyed caloric intake, engage with my group etc. they claim that there are no \"good\" or \"bad\" foods. however they have green, yellow and red foods. which are basically a new label for \"good\" and \"bad\". the lingo is geared to millennials (i'm genx- a natural skeptic). their \"psychology\" is very sophomoric and didn't work for me. i try to live a more ketogenic diet and this means too many red foods. they do have some cute lessons that did make me pause about what my triggers were, the type of eating i do emotionally, but i just found myself looking at the screen and saying, \"tell me something i don't know\". and finally, this week the lessons wouldn't open for me on the app and i received little help from the noom group besides suggestions to update the app. which i did, to no avail. still can't read the lesson. speaking of the group, there are a variety of people in my group and i found most to be novices. they were excited if they passed up a fast food joint. i haven't had fast food in ages. i could've just food journaled on my fitness pal or my fitbit. overall, this is a cookie cutter waste of my money. i'm feeling triggered lol. it may work for those who have no knowledge of fitness and diet- but i kept waiting for prolific advice and found it simplistic and unsuccessful for me. back to keto and my fitness pal.       \n",
              "65  i really like noom and have been using it for almost a month. the psychology behind eating is very informative and important. but i can't give the app more than 3 stars because it drives me nuts that the food log is not super user friendly or efficient. it needs the ability to copy meals from one day to the next and then be able to adjust the portions. i know i can make a \"recipe\" for the foods but i want the ability to quickly adjust the portion sizes of individual items so that if i can stay within my calorie budget if my other foods changed from the day before. i wish there were more fraction options, too... not all foods will be measured in perfect quarters, what about adding 1/3 and 2/3?!? also, when adding a new food to the app, when you go in to add the extra information (protein, carbs, etc.), once the keyboard is up on the iphone, you can't scroll down to input the bottom half of the screen's information and you also can't get the keyboard to go away. additionally, sometimes when you scan a food, the correct food pops up but the information isn't correct (ex. it lists 100 calories but it's actually 90 on the food label). there's nowhere to adjust that and/or report it. please, please, please add these features/make these changes (similar to myfitnesspal or carb manager) and then this will be the best! tia!!                                                                                                                                      \n",
              "67  i've been using another app to monitor my macros and exercise for some time. i was having weight issues because of the humidity and swelling and no continued weight loss. it's imperative i don't gain weight as i'm an amputee and device fit is essential. what i discovered was it was environmental and plateau. my weight went up. it was muscular as my clothes did not fit any differently. my device didn't fit good. that was weather and exercise related. it was hot and humid. i was doing interval training 5 days a week combined with biking. so when the weather changed everything changed and the plateau broke. my diet really remained the same. my devices began fitting the way they should fit once the humidity and temp dropped.\\ni was very unhappy with the way food was categorized by caloric density. i could not understand why some high fat foods were yellow and other foods were red. i even questioned it and got answers i just didn't like them. it was just something i wasn't willing to change. i also wasn't sure about doing weight daily. i learned to chart it weekly vs daily.\\ni'll continue to do my food and weight charting. even chart it daily. i find that helpful.\\nthe psychology being used is somewhat repetitive for me. grateful for the 2 week trial. very minimal assistance from specialists. every 4 days doesn't seem worth the price.\\nif it works for other, great! go for it. just not my thing.                                                           \n",
              "71  i was really excited to try noom, but that excitement was quickly dashed. the features are pretty poor compared to other apps. for instance, myfitnesspal has a far better calorie/food tracking function, even under their free plan. i cook all the time and it's not possibly to make and store recipes ahead of time. you also can't plan a day ahead. i've had to turn to myfitnesspal to plan my caloric intake for the next day, for instance. but what was really disappointing was the engagement with the \"1:1\" coach. i recognize that this isn't a quick exchange program where you have a running convo with your coach, but i did expect them to a.) read what you write in the chat, and b.) offer at least some response when you immediately respond. i asked about the 1:1 coaching in the group chat, and i was provided with three totally unrelated responses (so boiler plate that they must send). then i finally got a 1:1 \"coach\" and they asked a question about my deeper goals. that's a fairly hefty q to get your journey started, and i immediately responded. 24 hours later and it's still radio silence. checked w customer service to see if that's how it is, and they basically confirmed that a back and forth convo takes about 48 hours. that's ridiculous. it's one thing to be available for a full convo 10 mins every few days, but it's another to have them ghost you immediately after their initial engagement and being told that normal.                                     \n",
              "72  if you have a basic understanding of health & nutrition, this app is not for you. is it better than the elimination/restrictive diets that focus solely on what you eat? sure. but the lessons are really basic (surprise! sugar isn't healthy) and the tone is condescending. so. many. hashtags. the coaches aren't helpful. the app itself is not user-friendly at all; you're supposed to write goals in the app, but the app doesn't save them! so you're also supposed to take screenshots of what you wrotewhich they don't tell you. expectations upfront are unclear - for example, you can opt to join a group, but they don't add you to one until you've been in the app for two weeks. but they don't actually tell you that, so you're just left wondering what's going on. the messaging section is also awful and difficult to use. for a company that claims to serve so many customers, i would've expected a way better interface. the food logging functionality is ok, but my fitness pal is far superior. and don't believe their whole \"we don't label foods good or bad\" claimthey literally label them red and green. but somehow expect you not to see them as good/bad. a psychology-based company should know better, you'd think.\\ni see what they're trying to do, and i respect it. but the execution is pretty mediocre. your $ is better spent on christy harrison's intuitive eating course, or a program like smart strong bold.                                                            \n",
              "74  while, the concept of noom is pretty good, the app is not user-friendly except for daily activities. only available contact with a noom 'coach' is available; and conversation, although promised on a daily basis, is sporadic (once a week)at best. i had an issue with not receiving the meal plan and exercise plan - buyer beware - this is an add-on $$ at sign-up. when i inquired on how to receive a refund for the plan i didn't receive from my 'coach', the only thing i received was a link to cancel my membership. since i could not find any alternative contact information, that's just what i did, still not having received the meal plan/ exercise plan that i paid for up front.\\nfyi: noom makes you wait until your free trial period is over before setting you up with full access to the program - there's no real way to understand if the program is a fit for you until after you pay the full fee. sure, food logging and step counting is great, and there are some recipes in the app. and daily information, but this isn't really anything that can't be found outside the app. there's no real taste of the program until you pay the joining fee. i'm disappointed in the free trial that only showed me that i would need 10-15 minutes a day (plus time to log each meal) to read through daily lessons and complete tasks. not hooked enough to shell out $150+ to find out if it's a program i would stick to long term.                                                              \n",
              "77  i debated for several weeks on whether to give this a go. i honestly need more mindset help than anything else so i am enjoying the daily mindset work and the overall content. i am, however, completely disappointed in the food logging piece of this app and since it really is a very important component, it should be a priority in app development. it's one of the the worst food logging apps i've come across. the database is very small, the options for logging are limited (i.e. you can only log portions in 1/4 increments - no option for 1/3's) and you can't easily switch from, let's say breakfast to lunch. you have to complete your entry in one meal, go all the way back out to the home screen, reaccess the log and choose whatever meal you need to change or add to. noom could greatly enhance their product and overall user experience by integrating with other, more robust food logging apps like my fitness pal, or even integrating with the food logging app in fitbit or other fitness devices.\\nnoom also touts red, yellow and green foods, but i haven't found any actual lists yet. maybe i can access them on the website, but the app is my go to. it would make meal and snack planning much easier.\\nthe rating for this app would be higher if the food logging portion was more robust and user friendly and if i could easily access food lists from the app.                                                                                                              \n",
              "81  the idea of noom is good, but the practice was not all there for me. they say to spend ~10 minutes a day, which is accurate, but they didn't verify the content was quite childish. they used multiple hashtags for silly things that annoyed me more than taught me. my biggest issues with noom are the coach & food tracking. the coach only spoke to me maybe 1 time 5 day's a week. it didn't seem like she was interested in getting to know, but instead bringing up how i can handle quarantine/covid/etc. if she asked more sincere questions vs prompted questions, then she would have know i did not have any problems in quarantine as an introvert. the food tracking did not teach you about nutrition at all but instead just calorie counting. they sorted foods into red, yellow, and green based off caloric density, but that did not teach you the macros of each food. they also ask you to step on the scale daily. i was miserable each day stepping in the scale - losing a pound, gaining two back, etc. it took me two months before i brought up with my coach i didn't want to do this everyday because i felt it was making a negative impact on my. she said it was fine and a lot of noomers do that.. but it wasn't even provided to me as an option. overall, i think it really can work for some people, but based off the price, i would recommend my fitness pal.. it's way cheaper, has more options on food, and doesn't have the stupid coach.                                         \n",
              "83  i have over 100lbs to lose and know that dieting doesn't work and wanted to try something different before taking the first steps towards bariatric surgery. i'm at the five week mark and i'm not sure this is for me. first, i feel this program is not geared towards people who have 100+ pounds to lose but more so to people who have 15 or 20 pounds to lose. i also don't like the sporadic contact with your goal specialist. it takes a week to hear back instead of having a conversation in the moment as the program makes it seem. i also am not a fan of the group. i think grouping people by their goals would be so much better. i'm in a group with people who are not massively overweight and it's hard to be open when people with 15lbs to lose are like \"i'm on week 3 and lost 10lbs already!\" meanwhile, i'm on week five and i've lost 3lbs. it's so discouraging and makes me wish i could turn the group function off!\\ni also don't like having to weigh in every day. i've been taught that this is not a good way to measure weight loss as weight fluctuates due to many factors and weighing in weekly is more accurate for weight loss. also, as someone who is a recovered and now massively overweight anorexic, daily weighing is so, so triggering and brings back old habits but that's my own personal hang up.\\noverall, i love the psych tricks and they are helpful but i don't think the $44 a month is worth it for what i'm getting.                                            \n",
              "85  i like the app, it's helping me stay on food task and think about it from different perspectives. however there are quite a few bugs that i've noticed and which are taking away from the experience.\\n1. you can lose your progress. i bought a new iphone and redownloaded the app (old phone was erased when i upgraded) and i lost everything. my course progress, my weight, food and walking stats. i tried \"refreshing the app\" from the account page, nothing worked. i contacted the support team email and they were no help at all, came back with canned replies that did not solve the issue.\\n2. the meal reminders do not come at the right times at all. i was in a different time zone when i first downloaded the app so it's possible that it messed it up, but that should be an easy fix. just very off putting to be reminded to eat lunch at 7 am.\\n3. for the courses which are audio clips, i often try to read instead by hitting the \"read this lesson\" button but there is nothing to read it just skips it and takes me to the pop quiz.\\n4. seems like there understaffing from the noom guides, i was supposed to be put into a \"group\" a few days ago but have yet to see anything. but that is understandable and i'm not really in any need for it, just a small miss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
              "86  first, i'll state the positive. they have great recipe ideas and i love the use of tracking via caloric density.\\nokay, what annoyed me. first, scanning is terrible. it is blurry on an iphone 13 pro max when trying to scan. compared to other apps and it was definitely not my camera. second, i was offered a deal \"after\" i signed up for the free trial. third, i attempted to use the deal after already setting up my trial, but at the end of the process i was guilt tripped into giving a donation. i was told it cost 10 dollars to give me the deal and was asked to donate. i'm okay with this, but it makes more sense to say \"here is a deal for a donation amount of your choice\" so i'm not hit with it at the end of the process. fourthly, the interface is just odd. logging stuff and checking already logged stuff is too many button inputs. the analysis button is in a very weird place. if you want to analyze your red, yellow or green food progress. fifth, some foods were not accurate. why is white rice less calories per cup than brown rice, but the white rice is flagged as yellow? \\_()_/\\ni say this to help improve the product not to be mean. hope this stuff is helpful. for the ui stuff, development team should learn some ios design concepts. hitting a little x, versus swiping to delete is not as fluid. should take more advantage of some of the existing apple capabilities in xcode.                                                                                 \n",
              "90  it is hard to understate how cloying, juvenile, and patronizing the writing in noom's program is. if you have a rudimentary knowledge of nutrition and the slightest bit of self esteem, there is not much here worth paying money for. the personalized \"coaches\" are something between an ai chat bot and an intern copy pasting prewritten content - like talking to a pull string doll. the groups are dull. the daily hectoring to read the insipid curriculum or weigh in is just a hassle to boost metrics. the calorie counter was pretty slick, until they broke it on thanksgiving week 2021, and it now completely ignores exercise calories from apple health. the database is no better than the competition - user-built and full of errors. the weight graph is nice, but apple health does that, and it doesn't taunt you with unrealistic (and unhealthy) projections. i lost 55 lbs during my year-long stint with the app, but it wasn't because of any particular noom magic. any calorie counting app can do this for you without treating you like a none-too-bright child. i am now in a post-program maintenance phase, and the app keeps harassing me to sign up for another stint. it's has also started performing extremely poorly, taking forever to load or acknowledge input. i've stayed with the app out of habit and inertia, but it's time to move on.                                                                                                                                      \n",

              "12  doesn't live up to the hype. the meal tracker is an inferior version of the ww app. there is no way to save a recipe outside of the installed recipes in the android version - in my opinion not optimizing for android in 2023 is inexcusable. i switched from ww because i wasn't happy with the points system on ww, but am considering switching back after several months of using noom. ultimately both programs are based on very similar, sound weight loss principles, however.                              \n",
              "16  i have been using the android app for 2 years. recently, it takes forever to open and then once it does, it takes a long time to update anything. all of a sudden, i cannot update my steps. since i have a samsung watch it doesn't auto connect and i have to manually enter. getting really frustrated. nothing in app works well with samsung. cannot be synced to my watch. have to manually update my steps all the time and today.. that isnt working ...again. i would quit the app, but have a lot in it.    \n",
              "17  buggy, and doesn't work. i pressed the wrong button, and now i'm paying $160 every 6 months for something i don't want. first thing i go to is manage subscriptions and try to cancel and surprise surprise, it doesn't work. i reinstall and restart the app multiple times and i can't type in my email and password to cancel this thing. thanks a lot loom, instead of losing weight, i'm losing money. all i wanted was a free trial to test this dang app out. edit: right after posting, i am now paying 180   \n",
              "19  why won't you let me love you? i wanted to love the app. it has everything i want/need. but the app itself is terrible! i have had to uninstall it twice. it won't properly track what i've read or done. it won't consistently sync with my fitbit. and i've reached out to the help service twice with no response. this is my second time with noom and i never experienced this with the app before. pretty pointless program if the app won't work.                                                              \n",
              "20  i like the daily readings. i'm disappointed in the food tracking option. there is no option to create a recipe. i would like to be able to create a recipe that is multiple servings and the app be able to calculate the calories per serving. you can save \"meals\" but the quantities would be for a single serving. this option may determine whether or not i pay for anything past the trial.                                                                                                                    \n",

              "22  agree with everyone here. the program is great so far and i'll continue to try it, but the app is glitchy and difficult to navigate. it won't show or track my steps. i can't type in my calories for a meal and i have to instead scroll down a long list of numbers (sometimes hundreds or thousands long) until i get to the exact number of calories i want. it can't sync with samsung fit on my galaxy watch so i have to manually enter my fitness numbers. it feels like the app wants me to uninstall.       \n",
              "25  i'm having a problem with logging meals though. sometimes i go to review a meal earlier in the day (or previous day) and it looks like it's going well until you get to the confirmation page and it's magically become the current meal. i guess it isn't super important but kind of annoying if striving for accuracy. it also happens when adding exercise. now it thinks i've burned 900 calories in one day and i can't delete it.                                                                              \n",
              "26  it was great until no matter what i did or how many times i reached out to support, i can't use the app the way it's intended. i payed for it! it gives me a noomcoin every time i log in but i can't read anything. my course progress is halfway done but it starts me at the beginning. it's so frustrating. after 3 weeks of this with no answer, i'm cancelling my subscription and deleting the app. it's ridiculous. hope someone else can find some help with this. it definitely helped me while it worked.  \n",
              "27  it's not worth it. the classes are mediocre and even though you're paying for it, it sends a bunch of \"motivational popups\" when all i'm trying to do is log my weight/food/exercise. the calorie tracking portion of the app is also horrible. you can type in the amount of grams, you have scroll all the way through like an old 2nd gen ipod touch. i would also say about 60% of the calories listed are not correct, so i typically have manually enter the calories of an individual food with said dial. .   \n",
              "29  constant issues. the tech support regularly suggests to update the app, or delete cache and data and reinstall. sucks for trying to keep a decent record of your progress because they do not guarantee that all your data is saved on their servers. worse, why do i have to check for updates when all my other apps automatically update. so frustrating. for what you pay they should have a better app.                                                                                                          \n",
              "35  there are many ways to be healthy. noom hits some of them. it provides a lot of information but is not always easy to follow through on. the second time through doesn't have a one on one coach, which is ok. it's just one a week. it got a little tedious after a month the first time through. the group chat feature is missing or i'm not finding it. i like the updates to the app from the last time. the extra food plan and exercise plan was not worth it. the food plan are just links back to noom app   \n",
              "36  after a month no luck. i feel as though most of the information is common knowledge and repeat of what i have known for years. also, the daily weigh in is very depressing. i think a weekly weigh in would he more appropriate for the mind and to stay motivated. half the time the bar code does not work. although, 90% of our meals are homemade and it is hard to track calories. i have used free apps that work much better. since doing this i am running more and drinking more water, so that is a plus    \n",
              "38  after seeing the reviews ref canceling i sure hope i don't have that issue. i will give it until my subscription runs out but i'm not hopeful. the program hasn't really helped yet & the app could use some enhancements, i.e. a place for daily notes, etc. the app itself is ok in terms of reliability...so far. again, lots of reviewers seem to have issues. more to follow.                                                                                                                                    \n",
