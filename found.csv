The app is startup software, which results in a discounted experience across the native clients, and the web app (coaching is on native and medication is on web). I heard very little from my coach. Occasionally, I would receive a text message, ‚ÄúGreat job hydrating!‚Äù which didn't help me (drinking water is easy, losing weight is hard). I shared a lot of data with the app, which eventually felt tiresome as no one gave me tips on what I ate or feedback on exercise. I shared feedback on medication, which was a dreadful online and offline experience.

The first medication was for epilepsy, which decreased physical activity, caused weight gain, and depression (I take Zolft and Trintellex). My GP felt it was dangerous that Found put me on a medication that depresses the central nervous system. The second medication was for diabetes (my bloodwork shows I'm healthy), which resulted in severe nausea and taking two personal days off from work. My Found doctor couldn't locate my bloodwork, which I uploaded to the app, and I shared that I don't eat enough, so using medication to suppress my appetite worried me. I reached out for the 90-day refund, but no one got back to me. I began the experience with high trust, and I ended feeling a loss of trust.

Maybe consider a guide to working with your coach (e.g., what to expect, how they like to help, etc). Also, make sure the doctors can locate files like bloodwork and that they listen to concerns and even explain why they selected a particular medication for a client. Also, the lack of messaging as a conversation (no reply function - only a new message) might be causing disconnect.",text,related,https://itunes.apple.com/us/review?id=1581179653&type=Purple%20Software,0,Application,Application,0

I was given an anti-seizure med that did nothing but make me tired and disinterested. When it was time for me to refill my prescription, when I expressed my concerns that it was not effective for weight loss and not worth the side effects, they then wanted to prescribe a medication to treat diabetes, which I don‚Äôt have. They should stop claiming that part of their program is medication for weight loss with none of the medication they are willing to provide are on-label for weight loss and would be incredibly

I don‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt sync to my exercises in my Apple Watch just steps. This app would be much better and I would use it way more if it incorporated everything I need for my weight loss journey such as syncing with Apple Watch or iPhone for exercises, and a food tracking app such as lose it or my fitness pal. I often don‚Äôt log here because everything is in my other apps and I not gonna spend more time doing it twice.

Support tells me they can‚Äôt block that provider from my account (this seems like a HUGE invasion of privacy) and every time I get matched with that provider I need to manually write in and ask to be reassigned. But they don‚Äôt read the emails you send in, they just send you some templated email instead. Takes 4-5 days to hear back and then you get some copy-paste answer that doesn‚Äôt help with your question. I‚Äôm going to cancel my subscription and submit a concern with HIPAA violation complaint.
