The information they give you is broken down into easily digestible groups, their approach to weight loss is different than anything I‚Äôve tried before. There is the calorie tracking element, water intake tracking, steps taken, all that stuff but, it‚Äôs more there for you to see how you are progressing instead of being drilled into your head that you have to do all those things without fail everyday to see success. I‚Äôm down 10 pounds as of this morning and I‚Äôm very pleased with that. I haven‚Äôt been hungry all the time like some programs, I can tell I‚Äôm making some better choices when packing my lunch and going grocery shopping following their guidelines. I‚Äôve even found some healthier alternatives to certain things I would usually eat that still satisfy my craving without blowing my calorie budget or feeling guilty. I also enjoy the social aspect of the app, after your first few days you get to meet your team, which is compromised of other users and your group coach. It‚Äôs nice to be able to bounce concerns, frustrations and victories off each other and the group coach posts helpful suggestions and tips to work past plateaus and get you to the next level. Overall, I would recommend trying this company if you have some weight you‚Äôd like to shed without starving yourself or just eating cabbage & onion soup all day, everyday üòÇ",1416,13,9,false,9034153162,Black_widow85,Customers,361803662,2022-09-01T00:53:58+00:00,31775372,We're so happy to hear how much you've been enjoying your experience!

I have embraced breakfast which I had stopped eating because I hoped it would keep my overall calories down and all it did was make me hungrier for the afternoons.

us,634598719,2022-10-08T23:37:24Z,5,Fascinating.,"I‚Äôve been using this app for 5 months, and I thought I would get frustrated recording my meals every day knowing that I didn‚Äôt have full intentions to diet. Somewhere between the daily lessons and recording my weight daily, the way that I looked at food did actually change. The knowledge was in the back of my mind as I would roughly measure out serving sizes for a meal without much thought or effort. I gained weight for awhile after downloading, as initially I was just recording and not actually changing anything I normally did. The changes started to happen subtly and semi-automatically as I logged in every day, completing the lessons, recording my meals, and connecting my Fitbit to keep score of my daily steps. After a peak of 7 lbs gained while going through the program, I began to lose steadily. My highest recorded weight has been around 173 lbs. since joining Noom, and I am now at my lowest of 156 lbs. today. I decided to finally share a review, as the app creators deserve some credit after a 17 lb. loss, regardless of fluctuations throughout. With more effort and commitment than I have had, I‚Äôm sure others could lose the weight quicker. Either way, if you‚Äôre looking to lose weight in a sustainable way - this is a good app to have in your arsenal. (For further behavioral changes you wish to make that may or may not be weight loss related, I have found that ‚ÄúFabulous‚Äù is an excellent app to supplement your Noom usage.)",1446,0,0,false,9165251057,Jynx.237,Customers,1452499273,2022-10-10T09:26:21+00:00,32479834,We are so proud of your awesome progress!

After the first week or so of more interaction with her my goal specialist now checks in with me about once a week and asks me questions which help me think about things and stay engaged in my health journey. The team community coach posts a discussion topic I think every weekday and our little group of Noomers respond, like, and comment on each other‚Äôs posts. I think there‚Äôs a way to private message people but I haven‚Äôt needed to. I really look forward to the topics and people‚Äôs thoughts. I have lost a couple of pounds so far, which is great because what led me to do this was that I was slowly gaining and gaining! I‚Äôm enjoying Noom very much. I had a 2 week free intro and then figured it was worth another month. So far I think it has been worth the price, so I will probably continue for a while.

I don‚Äôt have to get rid of the stuff I love to get healthy. This app has taught me so much from being mindful of everything. I love that it teaches you so much and how to make the best decisions that work for you! The only recommendation I would have for Noom is consider having a call with your new members to show them how to best navigate through the app. I know that if I had something like that in the beginning it would of helped start my journey much more smoothly! I can seen that would be a reason someone doesn‚Äôt stick with the app if they are not as motivated.

However, I went to try on some of the clothes in my closet, and was disappointed when they didn‚Äôt fit, and was tired of ALWAYS being disappointed that nothing fits. Furthermore, I just had my third baby six months ago and have made no progress in losing the weight I need to lose to be healthy. So I decided to pay for the subscription, and I love it.

I said no not because I was depriving myself, but because I was not hungry, and did not (do not) want to allow environmental factors to drive my eating habits.

I lost the weight but gained it all back when we started on real food. So I have started Noom and have enjoyed it from the first day. I looked forward to the daily readings. It is changing how I label food and what I eat. No good or bad foods. My grocery shopping has changed with a lot more time spent in the produce section and whole foods. It feels wonderful to be gaining the knowledge of what are the healthiest choices to make. The daily recording of meals is so easy on the app  it keeps me focused on planning my calories and meals. 
The counselors I have are so supportive and knowledgeable. No, the weight isn‚Äôt dropping off like the restrictive diet I did before. Instead I‚Äôm loosing at a healthy rate of 1.5 to 2 pounds a week. My one on one counselor knows just what to tell me to keep me focused and avoid the hurdles I place on my journey. 
As I said before, I look forward to each day with Noom. It has given me a positive outlook. It isn‚Äôt a diet. It is changing my outlook. I‚Äôve stopped saying ‚ÄúI wish‚Äù and started saying ‚ÄúI will‚Äù.  Setting goals and not restrictions. I believe success is my only option with Noom.

Noom pretty much did just that (without the hypnosis- haha). The tips and ideas were small, easy to maintain, and really made sense. Losing weight wasn‚Äôt for a group or other people- it basically just taught me little things that help me keep on track and made losing weight simple-more of a lifestyle and not something I ‚Äúhad‚Äù to do.
I have felt for too long this pressure of having to please others and it always threw me into a down slide. It‚Äôs not for others...it‚Äôs for me! It explained why I hit a plateau.

I‚Äôm tired of losing and gaining the same weight (and more) over and over. I‚Äôve tried a lot of programs, and while losing weight is almost never an issue for me, keeping it off is. My eating habits were broken, and while I had success with WeightWatchers and MyFitnessPal, the former‚Äôs use of 0-point foods was no good for someone like me, who will overindulge on anything she feels she‚Äôs given license to, and the latter focused so much on calories, it sometimes made every food seem the same, so I would try to game the system to get as much food as I could and be scared of treats. Not good either. Noom is teaching me to listen to my hunger cues, think about nutrition, allow myself treats, and be more mindful about food in general. It is really helping! The weight is coming off, but more importantly, I feel my attitude and outlook on food changing, and I‚Äôm enjoying what I eat more instead of stressing about it.

But logging all these foods in, which is quite easy (I do it by dictating to my iPhone) has shown me how much those foods affect my calorie intake and health. I‚Äôve learned that I can still be happy eating those foods less often. I like that Noom does not necessarily exclude any food type or food group. But they definitely make you aware of the foods that will benefit you in weight loss. Noom is all about swapping out good things over less good things. It‚Äôs about figuring out how to avoid temptation by having the right foods around and the right frame of mind to deal with temptation. It‚Äôs about replacing good habits with less good habits. It‚Äôs about connecting things that you really like with things that you need to improve on in an effort to create a new and more beneficial habit.

The calories is automatically generated and is always wrong. For example, I am trying to log a recipe with 725 calories, it automatically makes it 2725 calories and you can‚Äôt change/correct it. I was told by support that it can take 3-6 months for the recipe to be in the system. What if you want to log it because you just had it and want to stay on track with your calories but can‚Äôt see it in your calorie bar because it Is incorrect?  There is no place to type the correct information. Makes no sense why Noom doesn‚Äôt have it and Lifesum does. I might switch to Lifesum because I do not want to wait 3-6 months to log a recipe I just ate. I want to know how much I eat calorie wise. Noom should have made it so it so you can fully customize your dish and nutrition info. This is the biggest let down of the app. 

I have talked to support about this 5 times in the past 2 days and most of them are clueless to what I want and those that do understand say ‚Äúit can take up to 3-6 months for it to finalize‚Äù.

Not much, but I do plan to stay with the program for at least another month.  While I feel that the basic concept is sound, there are some issues that need adjusting.  (1) The program‚Äôs daily lessons are centered around a working woman‚Äôs or man‚Äôs environment, i.e. office , co-workers, break room, etc.  They don‚Äôt seem to realize that there are those of us who have left this part of our lives behind and moved on, or, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any appropriate material for a stay-at-home mom or dad, or for any other younger, or older persons out of this working‚Äù category.  This hard for me to follow.  (2) They tout one-on-one attention, and, truly, you are given a food coach, assigned to a group, and given a group coach as well.  However, I‚Äôm not sure that these coaches are not bots.  Asked questions sometimes are not answered for 24-48 hours (and never on a weekend).  When they are answered, they are impersonal and often do not apply to the real situation at hand.

I lost 25 lbs in about 3.5 months and have kept it off for another 3. Noom was a huge part of it because it taught me to look at food differently. It was great because no foods are off limits and I can still have my favorites. The program was supposed to take 16 weeks to become a ‚ÄúNoom master‚Äù. The first 16 weeks were definitely helpful. I am now on week 23 and still haven‚Äôt ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù. The don‚Äôt really tell you how long you have left because there‚Äôs no way to look forward. My ‚Äúcourse progress‚Äù has not moved in weeks. Lessons have become less and less about food and food attitudes and more a repetitive rehashing of old lessons. Lots of talk about breaking and changing habits but we have already done this weeks ago. The website is no help either. I feel like I have come so far with Noom but by not actually ‚Äúending‚Äù the course I feel robbed of the final part of my weight loss journey.

I would have been fine if the had actually ‚Äúended‚Äù the course at week 16 allowing me to ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù and then give me the opportunity to keep going.

The app eases you into its program and each day gives you different tools to see the habits you have accepted as facts in your life. One of the best parts of the app is that it admits that there is no one size fits all path to weight loss. It even admits that the amount of weight you think you should lose might not be what best suits your lifestyle. Sometimes I find that the app throws so many ideas at you that it can be difficult at first to know which goals you should be setting each week and which things to focus on. But sticking with it definitely helps. Eventually you start to notice your own patterns, how much the app and its functions help you proceed to where you want to get to, and which parts of the app you can maybe disregard or save for another time. Caveat: I used the app in 2019, lost weight then traveled, stopped using it and gained it all back. I am back on Noom in quarantine knowing that one of the flaws I have found with Noom (and this just might be me personally) is that it is really successful when I‚Äôm in full control of my environment, but can be less so when that control decreases.

There are some improvements that, in my opinion, should be made.  One is to have a better proofread. There are a substantial number of typos in the articles. This unnecessarily detracts from the credibility of the information which you certainly want to avoid, and is easily avoidable.   Another is to make the logging easier by 1) not making a person close out the logging section to switch from one meal or snack to another 2) incorporating a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù search that brings up words that are close to a misspelled word so that you don‚Äôt get a blank unless you know how to spell a word exactly correctly.

Opportunities:  Too many inaccuracies in the food log database and too many entries for the same food type.  On demand coach response time is slow (days instead of hours).  Group coach is too scripted.  Groups include to broad of differences (The FB group I joined is more beneficial).  Too little transparency with app capabilities (I.e. have to reach out to coach to find out how color categories are calculated, how to make recipes, how to see average of color intake over time, etc.), too little transparency on cost and how it is calculated.  Members compare prices, which lends itself into thinking price per month varies.  Likewise feedback amongst members seems to imply continuing membership prices and what information you retain also lacks transparency (I am not to that stage yet for first hand experience).    
Suggestion:  Build on app to allow members to see to see caloric intake, food colors, water intake, on average in time segments.  This will help members to correlate weight gain/loss and plateaus with areas of the program they can improve in.  To go back day by day doesn‚Äôt give a birds eye look.  Perhaps coaches can see this, but members should be able to see directly.",1423,1,1,false,7284660189,CABCS,Customers,686660432,,,,,1620296023,1672890742,

I REALLY love Noom because there‚Äôs no guilt to the weight loss. That‚Äôs REALLY what‚Äôs made the lessons stick for me. You can go at your own pace, and no one yells at you to go faster or tell you that you‚Äôre not trying hard enough. My coach Portia is fantastic about checking in one a week or so, just to ask me if I‚Äôve run into any questions or how I feel like things are going ‚Äî and that‚Äôs IT! No guilt, no shame, no comparisons, just gosh dang support. Noom explores the psychology being weight loss, and the more important lifestyle changes behind them. And they like actually explain it, very clearly and kindly. Yeah okay, all of the #NoomNerd stuff is kinda #annoying, and I‚Äôm even a millennial lol.

On top of the first 2 months had articles that were audio that which really got me interested and which my active life being a traveling musician. I just dont find my attention span to do read research articles and be tested everyday. So I HATE LOGGING MEALS. Having to describe each item of food or recipe into an app takes forever. I felt that I spend at least a hour total a day logging food into this app. Talk about being judgmental and weary all day of what I have to eat. Not good for my mental health. Fail on this app. Way to be diet plan app with a fresh look. I had a death in the family and had to put the app on pause. I go to my gym quite often. Noom suggested exercise 3 months into the app but now I can pay more then the $160 plan for noom food plan and what not at $40 extra. But my artist management has paired me with a dietitian and personal trainer. And not getting wild reviews from the doctors. This app was misleading.

As they themselves say, it's psychology! Presented in a current, humorous style, Noom helped you get inside the Why's of your eating, helps you recognize and correct/combat/counteract what's not working, giving you helpful and picture tools to make real changes in your life. I initially thought I'd just use the free trial and then quit, because I didn't want to pay so much. But now I just finished my first week, and after the first two days I have had steady weight loss every day, and suddenly it IS worth it to pay for this, until I finish the course at least, because I don't want this life changing to end. 
  I will also say that the principles they teach you can be applied in many aspects of your life. Since the world has changed so much with the pandemic, this kind of help to examine yourself and the why's of your behavior, for me, has been a really amazing thing to help me start to get out of the funk of pandemic fatigue, whatever.

The philosophy and science behind the methods were the perfect ones for me and I have never felt so good while trying to lose weight, physically and mentally.  You do have to make a monetary commitment but that‚Äôs no different from most weight loss programs.  You also have to make a daily commitment to read for about 10 minutes, to log your foods and your activity level.  I believe this all made so much sense to me and became a large part of why I was successful beyond my wildest dreams.  I learned so much about myself and good and activity and living the right way for myself, making MY choices.  Learning why certain foods were advantageous to eat over others.  How certain foods made me feel.  Portion control was a huge lifestyle change and a real eye opening lesson learned!

It has helped me lose weight and work toward my goals. Bravo! Unfortunately, in the six months that I‚Äôve been using Noom, the user interface has gone steadily downhill. It‚Äôs now slow to load and slow to commit user data (e.g. during food logging). Why? Isn‚Äôt this app mostly cached static content + a small database? The app will also periodically log me out ‚Äúfor security reasons‚Äù and refuse to login without an internet connection - very frustrating when trying to catch up while on a flight w/o WiFi. I also find the graphics repetitive and insipid. New fonts are also all wrong. Any app that requires frequent user data input (like food logging) needs to feel like it loads and responds instantaneously. This one used to be fast and it‚Äôs not now. Also every software release is not a ‚Äúmajor release.‚Äù Some are probably more about new features, some more about bug fixes, etc. if Noom‚Äôs release notes were less cheerleading and more factual and specific, the user responses to releases would follow suit. In general, it appears that Noom needs to hire some more experienced software architects and incorporate higher UI performance metrics in their release criteria.

I am 65, and had rotator cuff surgery a week or so prior to starting Noom because I wanted to get fit, lose weight and get ready for retirement. I have done many diets in my life and the only ones that actually ever worked were the total fasting ones. I lost the weight and did it really quickly, problem is I could not sustain it because you have to go back to eating food and those diets never taught you how to eat real food with calories and fat and carb‚Äôs so the only thing that changed was the size of clothes I wore. 
Noom did not make me stop eating anything, no crazy restrictions and no starvation. Noom changed my life by introducing me to actual food and knowledge of what is different about the foods I eat and how I choose what I eat. You never walk away from a meal hungry nor do I go to bed hungry. I actually have lost weight, every day my scale changes.

In 20 days I‚Äôve lost 16 pounds and can see my goal for the first time in my future. I haven‚Äôt even begun to exercise yet. And, trust me, that ‚Äúdaily instruction‚Äù is max 15 minutes on the app. I‚Äôve made it my routine to log my morning weigh in, make a coffee, & read my daily Noom articles. It is laid out in small bites and they walk you through an understanding of how your body & brain work and achievable nutrition goals (nothing is ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù) to get you on your way.
I will reach my goal. And, I‚Äôve been jokingly saying, if I don‚Äôt this will be the first time I know why and have no excuses.

I tried Noom from May-November 2020 and, even though I didn‚Äôt hit my initial weight loss goal at the end of the 6 months due to getting busier, I still hit my goal by month 8.

For anyone wanting to lose weight, I would highly recommend noom, but I would strongly urge you to also put in the work. Actually listen to the advice from the articles and see what works for you. I personally really liked the articles regarding habits (ie: how to break your habits, how to make new ones) because those are the ones that have stuck with me the most.

Big surprise: Noom really does work. I‚Äôve been on it for about 6 weeks and have already lost 5 pounds, and it has never felt like a chore, a burden. or a project. And this occurred with my 50th birthday AND Thanksgiving in the middle, folks. Wow. Just gradual, natural, and healthy. I‚Äôve formed new and better eating habits, am far better at balancing the types of food I eat, and have gotten past several (inevitable) low periods with the help of my coach and Noom‚Äôs cognitive behavior-changing content - which is really fun and life-affirming to read, I promise you. Best moment: when I asked the coach if I could slip in a dose of my favorite French toast every so often and she replied, ‚ÄúAre you kidding? Of course! It‚Äôs all about moderation!‚Äù It‚Äôs lovely to hear that from someone other than myself - and I enjoyed every bite, and then went right back to my regular habits. Didn‚Äôt have any regrets, didn‚Äôt start craving more. Bottom line: most apps/plans target only one or two pieces of the puzzle.

I think my mindset will be better going forward. 

I think another feature that could make it stand out would be water tracking, specifically adding water intake for foods heavy with it (like watermelon) and letting us know how much extra to drink if we‚Äôve had high sodium. That‚Äôs so hard for me to consider, because I never really thought about my sodium intake to water ratio before. With the ability to add custom nutrition info to the app (and the wealth of uploaded items it already has) I think it would be pretty doable to create a system that says ‚Äúyou‚Äôve had __ mg of sodium today, you need to drink __ oz / mL of water to balance it out.‚Äù 

I personally would love to be able to track my water and sodium relationship in Noom, but the app is already well worth it without this feature.

It‚Äôs now been nearly three months and I haven‚Äôt lost any more weight.

When you‚Äôre struggling to revive motivation, becoming weighed down by information is not helpful. Second, the weight loss coaches are amateur.

It could be so much better easier to log (seems like a lot of steps to get to the logging part and isn‚Äôt that an important piece of this app?) and then the nutrition information is often wrong. I initially liked that it had so many foods already in its database, but I find I have to check the info to the food packages and it‚Äôs often wrong, so then I have to input it separately or find a way to change my portion in the app to correctly log the calories I consumed. This is really annoying and a huge disappointment. I‚Äôve used other apps like Lose It which seemed more accurate overall. Wish their databases could be updated. I contacted them once and they said that the info was wrong because the manufacturer changed their portion size since their last update.

Thought it was pricey but decided it would only cost more if I waited until I had 15 or 20 lbs to lose. I like the program and the fact that the daily messages (about 10 min worth of reading) are teaching me about the why of weight issues and how best to work with your own internal messaging. I like the group contact but my coach has pretty much been absent. She checks in maybe once a week so she isn‚Äôt available when I‚Äôm having a bad time. That is disappointing but the group is there so that helps tho the response is not always immediate when I need a boost most. That said, I never had that AT ALL in other programs. It can tedious to log all food I eat on the app but it is working. It has helped me see what gets me in trouble the most (mindless eating in front of a screen). Controlling that habit is a work in progress. Overall, I am so glad I found this. I can choose the calorie amount to eat and I have lost 5 pounds. I chose 1400 calories a day as opposed to the 1200 recommended. Slower this way but more realistic and less painful. I definitely recommend giving this program a try.",1288,0,0,false,7409937231,Gushy muscat,Customers,368000640,,,,,1623043620,1672890710,

The psychology behind eating is very informative and important. But I can‚Äôt give the app more than 3 stars because it drives me nuts that the food log is not super user friendly or efficient. It needs the ability to copy meals from one day to the next and then be able to adjust the portions. I know I can make a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for the foods but I want the ability to quickly adjust the portion sizes of individual items so that if I can stay within my calorie budget if my other foods changed from the day before. I wish there were more fraction options, too... not all foods will be measured in perfect quarters, what about adding 1/3 and 2/3?!? Also, when adding a new food to the app, when you go in to add the extra information (protein, carbs, etc.), once the keyboard is up on the iPhone, you can‚Äôt scroll down to input the bottom half of the screen‚Äôs information and you also can‚Äôt get the keyboard to go away. Additionally,  sometimes when you scan a food, the correct food pops up but the information isn‚Äôt correct (ex. it lists 100 calories but it‚Äôs actually 90 on the food label). There‚Äôs nowhere to adjust that and/or report it. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ADD THESE FEATURES/MAKE THESE CHANGES (similar to MyFitnessPal or Carb Manager) and then this will be the best!

I was also skeptical about counting calories, but I understand now it‚Äôs more about figuring out what foods will satisfy you without excessively adding to your daily calorie intake. I wish there was even a little bit of focus on macronutrients. The fact that there is no distinction between healthy and unhealthy fats in the food tracker is troubling to me. Most importantly!! I am really really irritated by the tone some of the articles ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in. Not only is the sense of ‚Äúhumor‚Äù annoying, but some of them are just rude about people Noom doesn‚Äôt seem to think will be using their app. When every article that mentions work refers to working at a desk and hanging out in a break room with free snacks?

I was having weight issues because of the humidity and swelling and no continued weight loss. It‚Äôs imperative I don‚Äôt gain weight as I‚Äôm an amputee and device fit is essential. What I discovered was it was environmental and plateau. My weight went up. It was muscular as my clothes did not fit any differently. My device didn‚Äôt fit good. That was weather and exercise related. It was hot and humid. I was doing interval training 5 days a week combined with biking. So when the weather changed everything changed and the plateau broke. My diet really remained the same. My devices began fitting the way they should fit once the humidity and temp dropped. 
 I was very unhappy with the way food was categorized by caloric density. I could not understand why some high fat foods were Yellow and other foods were Red. I even questioned it and got answers I just didn‚Äôt like them. It was just something I wasn‚Äôt willing to change. I also wasn‚Äôt sure about doing weight daily. I learned to chart it weekly vs daily. 
I‚Äôll continue to do my food and weight charting. Even chart it daily. I find that helpful.
The psychology being used is somewhat repetitive for me. Grateful for the 2 week trial. Very minimal assistance from specialists. Every 4 days doesn‚Äôt seem worth the price.

I have nothing to compare it to short of reading labels and writing on paper, so I don‚Äôt know how it compares in simplicity and accuracy with other apps that might be out there. I thought it was pretty easy. What I didn‚Äôt use or find helpful: The weekly check-in from my goal specialist and the group coaching. Once a week I would get asked a generic question by my specialist. They only communicate with you once a week. Also, group coaching on an app is just not for me. I don‚Äôt want to be looking at my phone all day and reading other people‚Äôs responses and trying to figure out what to say back. That is way too time-consuming. So after the first introduction I never went back to the group. I didn‚Äôt have too much weight to lose, I signed up to give me some accountability for what I was eating. It was eye-opening. I liked Noom for tracking what I ate and making me think differently. I did it for two months and it helped, I took off the few lbs I wanted to lose and have maintained within a couple pounds.

Having the support both from the articles in the app and the group chat have definitely helped me. I went in with about 50 pounds to lose to get to a healthy weight, and I needed an easy, nonjudgemental place to start. Currently I‚Äôm down about 24 pounds, feeling great. The app offers me support and gives me someone to talk to about my struggles that people in my everyday life just don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs somewhat customizable, I wanted to lose weight quicker, so I might have a different ‚Äúcalorie budget‚Äù than others. 
The app didn‚Äôt really tell me anything I didn‚Äôt know about weight loss. If you think you can lower your calorie consumption and exercise regularly on your own, then you might not need this. But for me it‚Äôs important to have daily reminders and tips on the psychology behind weight loss. 

My criticism would be on the payment plan. The app charges you four months all at once after the free trial. At $44 a month, it‚Äôs a big chunk of cash for a broke college student like me. I would have preferred to pay by month to lessen the load. I found myself using a lot of the features from the app at first, but now I think I have the hang of it.

There is absolutely no organization. You are supposed to share things with the group but when you click on the link it doesn‚Äôt take you to a ‚Äúmodule‚Äù for that particular response.  It is just a big mess of responses to all different questions in no particular order that I can see.   So instead of everyone responding to question A and discussing, you have to scroll through the whole mess.   If you get a notification that someone responded to your comments or mentioned you in a comment and you click the notification same thing you are just dumped in the mess. 
People feel the need to post everything they have done. Again no specific module.   
I don‚Äôt have time to scroll through all of it.   I think Noomnerds need to look at how an online course or other apps, like Facebook, are set up. When you click a link it should take you to module on that question where everyone is responding.  If you get a notification clicking it should take you to the comment.

The features are pretty poor compared to other apps.  For instance, MyFitnessPal has a far better calorie/food tracking function, even under their free plan.  I cook all the time and it‚Äôs not possibly to make and store recipes ahead of time. You also can‚Äôt plan a day ahead.  I‚Äôve had to turn to myfitnesspal to plan my caloric intake for the next day, for instance. But what was really disappointing was the engagement with the ‚Äú1:1‚Äù coach.  I recognize that this isn‚Äôt a quick exchange program where you have a running convo with your coach, but I did expect them to a.) read what you write in the chat, and b.) offer at least some response when you immediately respond.  I asked about the 1:1 coaching in the group chat, and I was provided with three totally unrelated responses (so boiler plate that they must send).  Then I finally got a 1:1 ‚Äúcoach‚Äù and they asked a question about my deeper goals.  That‚Äôs a fairly hefty Q to get your journey started, and I immediately responded.  24 hours later and it‚Äôs still radio silence.  Checked w customer service to see if that‚Äôs how it is, and they basically confirmed that a back and forth convo takes about 48 hours. That‚Äôs ridiculous.  It‚Äôs one thing to be available for a full convo 10 mins every few days, but it‚Äôs another to have them ghost you immediately after their initial engagement and being told that normal.",1445,0,0,false,8433378268,JDubs0701,Customers,105117550,2022-03-09T15:31:01+00:00,28474729,We are working hard to improve and genuinely appreciate this honest feedback.

The baseline principle is straightforward: you have to track everything you eat and get active to lose weight. That part really isn‚Äôt in doubt or debatable. You can restrict calories, carbs, fat, etc. and succeed in losing weight. However, if in your mind there are two distinct periods: the diet, when you are losing weight; and then the post-diet, when you return to eating and exercise habits of before the diet, you‚Äôre going to gain all of the weight back and perhaps more.
What is different about Noom is that it does not prohibit specific foods and label them as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or off-limits. Yes, you have to make choices but Noom acknowledges the importance of psychology and developing good habits that are sustainable. Will it work for everyone? No. But not everyone will commit to taking an honest look at their personal habits and make a lifestyle change. Some people will just use it to lose 10 or 15 pounds and then go back to living exactly the way they did before.

They say to spend ~10 minutes a day, which is accurate, but they didn‚Äôt verify the content was quite childish. They used multiple hashtags for silly things that annoyed me more than taught me. My biggest issues with Noom are the Coach & Food tracking. The coach only spoke to me MAYBE 1 time 5 day‚Äôs a week. It didn‚Äôt seem like she was interested in getting to know, but instead bringing up how I can handle quarantine/covid/etc. If she asked more sincere questions vs prompted questions, then she would have know I did not have any problems in quarantine as an introvert. The food tracking did not teach you about nutrition AT ALL but instead just calorie counting. They sorted foods into red, yellow, and green based off caloric density, but that did not teach you the macros of each food. They also ask you to step on the scale daily. I was miserable each day stepping in the scale - losing a pound, gaining two back, etc. It took me two months before I brought up with my coach I didn‚Äôt want to do this everyday because I felt it was making a negative impact on my. She said it was fine and a lot of Noomers do that.. but it wasn‚Äôt even provided to me as an option.

It has been one month and I have lost 10 pounds in a way that feels sustainable, encouraging and supported. In addition to all of the information and help noon provides, I have also been connected to a Noom support group where we help each other and troubleshoot together.

I‚Äôm at the five week mark and I‚Äôm not sure this is for me. First, I feel this program is not geared towards people who have 100+ pounds to lose but more so to people who have 15 or 20 pounds to lose. I also don‚Äôt like the sporadic contact with your goal specialist. It takes a week to hear back instead of having a conversation in the moment as the program makes it seem. I also am not a fan of the group. I think grouping people by their goals would be so much better. I‚Äôm in a group with people who are not massively overweight and it‚Äôs hard to be open when people with 15lbs to lose are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on week 3 and lost 10lbs already!‚Äù meanwhile, I‚Äôm on week five and I‚Äôve lost 3lbs. It‚Äôs so discouraging and makes me wish I could turn the group function off! 

I also don‚Äôt like having to weigh in every day. I‚Äôve been taught that this is not a good way to measure weight loss as weight fluctuates due to many factors and weighing in weekly is more accurate for weight loss. Also, as someone who is a recovered and now massively overweight anorexic, daily weighing is so, so triggering and brings back old habits but that‚Äôs my own personal hang up.

However there are quite a few bugs that I‚Äôve noticed and which are taking away from the experience. 
1. You can lose your progress. I bought a new iPhone and redownloaded the app (old phone was erased when I upgraded) and I lost everything. My course progress, my weight, food and walking stats. I tried ‚Äúrefreshing the app‚Äù from the account page, nothing worked. I contacted the support team email and they were no help at all, came back with canned replies that did not solve the issue. 
2. The meal reminders do not come at the right times at all. I was in a different time zone when I first downloaded the app so it‚Äôs possible that it messed it up, but that should be an easy fix. Just very off putting to be reminded to eat lunch at 7 am. 
3. For the courses which are audio clips, I often try to read instead by hitting the ‚ÄúRead this lesson‚Äù button but there is nothing to read it just skips it and takes me to the pop quiz. 
4. Seems like there understaffing from the Noom guides, I was supposed to be put into a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù a few days ago but have yet to see anything.

Okay, what annoyed me. First, scanning is terrible. It is blurry on an iPhone 13 Pro Max when trying to scan. Compared to other apps and it was definitely not my camera. Second, I was offered a deal ‚Äúafter‚Äù I signed up for the free trial. Third, I attempted to use the deal after already setting up my trial, but at the end of the process I was guilt tripped into giving a donation. I was told it cost 10 dollars to give me the deal and was asked to donate. I‚Äôm okay with this,  but it makes more sense to say ‚Äúhere is a deal for a donation amount of your choice‚Äù so I‚Äôm not hit with it at the end of the process. Fourthly, the interface is just odd. Logging stuff and checking already logged stuff is too many button inputs. The Analysis button is in a very weird place. If you want to analyze your red, yellow or green food progress. Fifth, some foods were not accurate. Why is white rice less calories per cup than brown rice, but the white rice is flagged as yellow?  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

I say this to help improve the product not to be mean. Hope this stuff is helpful. For the UI stuff, development team should learn some iOS design concepts.

The calorie counter was pretty slick, until they broke it on Thanksgiving week 2021, and it now completely ignores exercise calories from Apple Health.

The biggest day to day problem I have is with their inconsistent link to Garmin.  For weigh-ins everything is fine and it‚Äôs scary how quickly the app ‚Äòknows‚Äô my weight from my electronic Garmin scale.  For steps I linked Noom to Garmin but it‚Äôs very buggy.  First, the steps show up with a huge lag, even though my steps are updated correctly and quickly in Garmin Connect.   It is sometimes hours and I am never sure if all of my steps for the day have been updated before the clock turns over to a new day.  Second, when the steps do feed into Noom they do not show on the apps summary page but so show up when you drill down in the specific steps page.   Finally, it would be nice if Garmin activities would feed into the app.   I find myself manually adding cycling, hiking, etc activities into Noom. And even when I do fill in the distances and times, Noom WAY overestimates my calories burned compared to Garmin to the point of being ridiculous.  I‚Äôd like Noom to be able to import all of my activity data like other apps do.  Until then the app is just a basic (and not state of the art) food log.  Is having access to the ‚Äòlessons‚Äô worth the hassle of using the app?  I am not sure yet.",1303,1,1,false,8969751341,Kmooreiii,Customers,35809210,2022-08-13T12:06:38+00:00,31440732,"We're sorry to hear that you're experiencing some trouble with your Garmin steps connecting to Noom and we genuinely appreciate your feedback regarding what you'd like to see improved.

us,634598719,2020-08-06T16:47:29Z,4,Really works,"I‚Äôm on Noom again for the second time now. The first time I used it for 2 months and lost almost 30lbs. It works really well. Yes, it‚Äôs a little expensive but it‚Äôs much more than a calorie tracker. It tells you the science behind weight loss and it helps you to make life style changes. It also puts everything you eat into perspectives. I had a lot of complaints the last time I used it because it wanted you to read constantly but they updated it to a couple of articles a day that only takes like 5 minutes. My only complaint and why it‚Äôs not 5 stars is because of the ‚Äúcoaches.‚Äù You have a personal coach and a group coach. Personally, I don‚Äôt like either one. Not that they aren‚Äôt nice, but because they don‚Äôt do much of anything and it‚Äôs kind of annoying. If you have questions about what to do in situations they don‚Äôt really have good replies. Just generic prewritten things, it almost feels like talking to a bot. They don‚Äôt feel like an actual person is writing anything to what you‚Äôre saying, but more like they‚Äôre just going off a prompt. The group is still fun because you get to talk to other noom users and compare stories and recommendations. Overall I like the app a lot and want to keep using it until I reach my goal. Just wish they‚Äôd get better at coaching.",1277,2,2,false,6287575273,Jesslovessebby,Customers,407604577,2020-08-21T13:22:15+00:00,17420004,We are sorry to hear you are not connecting with your coach and we would be happy to match you with a new coach!
