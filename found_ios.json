However, the app was clearly an afterthought and while they seem to be making improvements it’s pretty disappointing in comparison to other weight loss companies like Noom. The weight tracker is clunky and hard to see progress, the meal log etc are pretty useless and overall it’s hard to see any data that helps you analyze patterns and trends. The app needs a lot of work to keep up with its competitors but if they can get it upgraded, their underlying service is great!",

The doctor was able to pinpoint exactly what my issue was and so far, my insane cravings and huge appetite have gone down. For once, I don’t feel restricted in what I eat. For once, Im not feeling like I should punish myself for eating ice cream! My coach Jenny is absolutely lovely and checks in on me all the time. She’s responsive, has sent me good feedback and tips, and has just been very encouraging and understanding about everything. My meds have been good but I’ve had some annoying side effects with them; My  doc was super responsive when I reported the issues and he was quick to help me find an alternative that would still help me. I am loving this entire program so far. The holistic approach has been helping me learn to love myself more and to be kinder to myself . Thank you so much Jenny and dr peacock",

I highly recommend to anyone ready to reinvest in themself.",

Doctors don’t answer questions, they are not prepared to answers simple questions as : why did you choose this medication for me? Zoom consultations are not available so you can’t really speak to them, answers turnaround are terrible. I paid for a month and I couldn’t even get my medicine due to doctors indifference. (Makes me think who is answering questions in the other side). Positive: coach is good and sent messages to help you through out the process and even available to help with this naughty app.",

I do not want to track anything due to triggering my eating disorder, but the app forces you to. I informed the \"doctor\" (who never speaks to you or even reads over your health history) that I do not want certain meds because they cause bad side effects and then this anonymous doctor bot prescribed me those exact meds! My friend who signed up for Found was also prescribed the same exact meds and sent the same exact messages. How does this place exist? I was an idiot and took some of the meds because I am desperate to lose weight but of course, they made me sick, worsened my eating disorder and I had to go to Urgent Care. Shame on you, Found!",

The provider chose meds and was abrupt and didn’t look at medical records, but still prescribed a medication with a brief summary. I did more reading and there are very dangerous side effects that were not communicated. I questioned it and she said if I noticed them, to message her. But it takes 72 hours to get a response? And if you look closely everywhere you want to talk about a med it says “call 911.” This process took over a week and they still didn’t send the meds so I messaged about alternatives and she never responded. They immediately broke trust. \n\nThis app/membership is dangerous. You’re not getting the support and coaching you really need, and if you’ve never taken meds like this (live I haven’t) you don’t actually have a doctor. It’s a quick service pharmacy and not what is advertised. They are preying on people looking for support. \n\nI looked into the 90 day money back guarantee and in the fine print there are a bunch of hoops that basically mean you’re on your own. I’m out $100 for nothing. Don’t do this-go find an in person doctor and talk about your options.",

I haven’t seen any indication of improvement on the app or with my new coach. In fact, I preferred my former coach and now feel demotivated having to start from zero with someone else. The app experience is pretty minimal — not a lot of functionality (you can’t even input data for the prior day, which is inconvenient for anyone who gets busy and forgets to upload their weight, etc.). The app also relies too heavily on basic gamification, which feels geared toward someone 1/3 my age. Give me timely, personalized insights, not useless points for drinking enough water in a day.",

The app is startup software, which results in a discounted experience across the native clients, and the web app (coaching is on native and medication is on web). I heard very little from my coach. Occasionally, I would receive a text message, “Great job hydrating!” which didn't help me (drinking water is easy, losing weight is hard). I shared a lot of data with the app, which eventually felt tiresome as no one gave me tips on what I ate or feedback on exercise. I shared feedback on medication, which was a dreadful online and offline experience.\n\nThe first medication was for epilepsy, which decreased physical activity, caused weight gain, and depression (I take Zolft and Trintellex). My GP felt it was dangerous that Found put me on a medication that depresses the central nervous system. The second medication was for diabetes (my bloodwork shows I'm healthy), which resulted in severe nausea and taking two personal days off from work. My Found doctor couldn't locate my bloodwork, which I uploaded to the app, and I shared that I don't eat enough, so using medication to suppress my appetite worried me. I reached out for the 90-day refund, but no one got back to me. I began the experience with high trust, and I ended feeling a loss of trust.\n\nMaybe consider a guide to working with your coach (e.g., what to expect, how they like to help, etc). Also, make sure the doctors can locate files like bloodwork and that they listen to concerns and even explain why they selected a particular medication for a client. Also, the lack of messaging as a conversation (no reply function - only a new message) might be causing disconnect.",

I ended up taking the first months medication and renenrolling because it helped hoping that had been a 1 off issue of not receiving a reply. Then I had another issue with payment and submitted help to the found support team and again no one replied. In total I emailed three times before the final cancellation with no response. I posted this here and now the review is gone for some reason? The only reason I even noticed is because the developer posted their generic response to contact their review team and when I did they haven’t even responded to that and I sent 12 days ago. \n\nThis company is sketchy and won’t respond to you period. I over paid by a lot but will never see that money back.",

The first medicine they offered had worsening of depressive symptoms as it’s main side effect. I tried it for 6 weeks, but felt horrible and then asked for another medication citing the side effects as the reason I wanted to change.\n\nThe provider offered a different medication and confusing directions for how to taper off the first one. When I asked for clarification, he sent the same instructions but with a snarky note. I responded again asking for clear directions, and he finally responded.\n\nI started the second medication and immediately had a side effect. The instructions with the medication advised me to contact my provider right away if this occurred. It took THREE days to get a response from Found. Meanwhile, I went to my regular doctor.\n\nFor me, the medications Found offers have too many adverse side effects. I would not recommend this program.\n\nThe one bright spot was my coach, Kristin.

Support tells me they can’t block that provider from my account (this seems like a HUGE invasion of privacy) and every time I get matched with that provider I need to manually write in and ask to be reassigned. But they don’t read the emails you send in, they just send you some templated email instead. Takes 4-5 days to hear back and then you get some copy-paste answer that doesn’t help with your question. I’m going to cancel my subscription and submit a concern with HIPAA violation complaint. This is truly a disaster.",
